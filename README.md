## Slack bot written in JavaScript for Spin

This Slack bot shows you today's World Cup matches. It's written to demonstrate the use of the [Spin JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-js-sdk)

### Building the example

You need `spinjs` in your path for the build to work.

`spinjs` can be built from the [Spin JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-js-sdk)

```
spin build
```

### Running the example

```
spin up --follow-all
```

Use e.g. `curl -v http://127.0.0.1:3000` to test that it's working.
